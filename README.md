# Tech_Academy_C_Net_2
This repository is for my C# and .NET projects with the Tech Academy. They range from simple console applications using basic C# concepts, to more complex applications using the .NET and .NET Core frameworks following the MVC architecture. The final two projects use the Entity Framework for data modeling with a SQL database.

## Projects:
* [Twenty One Game](https://github.com/chasetmartin/Tech_Academy_C_Net_2/tree/main/TwentyOne)
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/chasetmartin/Tech_Academy_C_Net_2/tree/main/CarInsurance)
* [Newsletter MVC](https://github.com/chasetmartin/Tech_Academy_C_Net_2/tree/main/TechAcadStudentsMVC)

### Twenty One Game
This project is a fully functional console application that allows the user to play a game of blackjack against a computer dealer, with realtime betting involved. The project demonstrates many core concepts of C# object-oriented programming, including classes and abstract classes with and without inheritcance, constructors, in various operators, parsing and lambda functions, and more.
### Car Insurance
This is an ASP.NET MVC Entity Framework application that takes input of user variables in form with many data types and using business logic to calculate a car insurance quote for the user, given the inputs. Various skills are on display, including the ability to write logic using Date/Time functions, and the ability to use the Entity Framework to implement CRUD funcitonality with a SQL database in a web application.
### Newsletter
This simple .NET Framework MVC application creates a simple admin panel where a company could keep track of newsletter subscriptions based on the results of an online form. It demonstrates knowledge of the .NET Framework for simple CRUD functionality.
